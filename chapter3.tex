\end{enumerate}

\section{\Cyclus}
In this section, we describe \Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator.
In \Cyclus, an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, 
each entity (i.e. \texttt{Region}, \texttt{Institution}, or \texttt{Facility}) in the 
fuel cycle is an agent. 
\texttt{Region} agents represent geographical or political areas 
in which \texttt{Institution}
and \texttt{Facility} agents reside. 
\texttt{Institution} agents represent legal operating organizations such as
utilities, governments, and control the 
deployment and decommissioning of \texttt{Facility} agents
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}.
\texttt{Facility} agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities
such as mines, conversion facilities, reactors, reprocessing facilities, 
etc. 
Figure \ref{fig:cyclus} illustrates \Cyclus' modular architecture in which 
user-selected archetypes are loaded into the simulation.  
\Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014}
provides basic \texttt{Region}, \texttt{Institution}, 
and \texttt{Facility} archetypes compatible with \Cyclus. 
\Cyclus records isotopic mass flows and inventories at an agent level.

        (API) to modularly load user-selected archetypes into the \Cyclus simulation
         \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}.}

\end{figure}

Two of \Cyclus' main design objectives are user customization and 
extensibility. 
\Cyclus' modularity, open architecture, and agent interchangeability 
achieve these objectives.
The modularity and open architecture provide users with a 
platform to develop custom facilities with their chosen fidelity 
and capabilities. 
Agent interchangeability facilitates the configuration of custom fuel 
cycles and direct comparisons of alternative modeling methodologies 
and facility concepts \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
\Cyclus' input file has an XML or JSON format, and the output file is 
a SQLite or HDF5 database. 

\Cyclus' agent-based modeling, modular architecture, and flexible extendability make 
it a one-of-a-kind fuel cycle simulator since most fuel cycle simulators (table \ref{tab:nfctools})
have inflexible architectures and use fleet-based modeling. 
Therefore, it is straightforward to introduce a \Cyclus \texttt{Institution}
agent to enable demand-driven deployment of reactor and supporting fuel cycle facilities.

\section{Demand driven deployment capability in \Cyclus (\deploy)}
In 2016, a DOE initiative sought to understand and evaluate the 
transition from the current once through LWR fuel cycle (EG01) 
to promising future nuclear fuel cycles \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.
In \Cyclus, reactor facilities are automatically 
deployed to meet user-defined power demand. 
However, the user is required to define a deployment scheme for all 
supporting facilities to avoid any supply chain 
gaps or resulting idle reactor capacity. 
To avoid this issue, users 
must set infinite capacities for the support facilities, 
but this inaccurately represents reality and obfuscates 
required capacities. 
Manually determining a deployment scheme for a once-through 
fuel cycle is straightforward, however, for complex fuel cycle 
scenarios, it is not.   
To ease setting up realistic nuclear fuel cycle simulations, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator
must bring dynamic demand-responsive deployment decisions into 
the simulation logic \cite{huff_current_2017}. 
This means the nuclear fuel cycle simulator decides how many mines, 
mills, enrichment facilities,
reprocessing facilities, etc are deployed to support dynamically 
changing power demand and reactor types.  
Thus, a next-generation nuclear fuel cycle simulator must predictively and 
automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined 
power demand. 
Therefore, the Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetypes project
(NEUP-FY16-10512) was initiated to develop demand-driven deployment 
capabilities in \Cyclus.
This capability, \deploy, is a \Cyclus \texttt{Institution}
agent that deploys facilities to meet user-defined power demand. 

\subsection{\deploy framework}
\label{sec:d3ploy}

\deploy was developed collaboratively with contributors from 
both \gls{UIUC} and \gls{USC}. 
A breakdown of contributions can be viewed at the \deploy 
github repository \cite{noauthor_arfc/d3ploy:_2019}.  

In \Cyclus, developers have the option to design 
agents using C++ or Python. 
The \deploy \texttt{Institution} agent was 
implemented in Python to enable the use of 
well-developed time series forecasting Python packages. 

In a \Cyclus simulation, at every time step, \deploy 
predicts the supply and demand of each commodity for the next time 
step. 
Commodities refer to materials in the nuclear fuel cycle such as 
reactor fuel. 
Upon undersupply for any commodity, 
\deploy deploys facilities to meet its predicted demand.
Therefore, if the simulation begins with user-defined power 
demand, \deploy deploys reactors to meet power demand, 
followed by enrichment facilities to meet fuel demand, and so on,
to create the supply chain.
Based on the demand and supply trends of each commodity, 
\deploy predicts their 
future demand and supply, and deploys facilities 
accordingly to meet the future demand to prevent demand 
from surpassing supply. 
Figure \ref{fig:flow} shows the logical flow of \deploy 
at every time step. 
In subsequent subsections, we describe how to set up a 
transition scenario using \deploy and the input parameters 
\deploy accepts.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{\deploy logic flow at every timestep in \Cyclus \cite{chee_demonstration_2019}.}
    \label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}

\deploy aims to minimize the undersupply of power:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:pow}
	obj &= min \sum_{t=1}^{t_{f}} |D_{t,p}-S_{t,p}|.
    \intertext{where:}
    t_f &= \mbox{Number of time steps [months]} \nonumber \\ 
    t &= \mbox{time [month]} \nonumber \\
	D &= \mbox{Demand} \nonumber\\
	S &= \mbox{Supply} \nonumber\\
	p &= \mbox{power [MW]} \nonumber 
\end{align} 
The sub-objectives are to minimize the number of time 
steps of undersupply or under-capacity of any 
commodity: 
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:sub1}
	obj = min \sum_{c=1}^{M}\sum_{t=1}^{t_f} |D_{t,c}-S_{t,c}|,
\end{align}
and to minimize excessive oversupply of all commodities: 
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:sub2}
    obj &= min \sum_{c=1}^{M}\sum_{t=1}^{t_f} |S_{t,c}-D_{t,c}|.
\intertext{where:}
    c &= \mbox{commodity type} \nonumber \\
	M &= \mbox{Number of commmodities} \nonumber
\end{align} 
Minimizing excessive oversupply 
reflects reality, in which utilities ensure grid availability 
by ensuring power plants are never short of fuel while 
avoiding expensive storage of excess fuel. 
Nuclear fuel cycle simulations often face power shortages 
due to lack of viable fuel, despite having sufficient installed 
reactor capacity.  
Using \deploy to automate the deployment of supporting 
facilities prevents this. 

\subsubsection{\textbf{Structure}}
Front-end facilities 
meet the demand for commodities they produce, whereas back-end 
facilities meet supply for the commodities they demand. 
Therefore, in \deploy two distinct institutions control 
front-end and back-end fuel cycle facilities: 
\texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst} and 
\texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst}, respectively. 
For example, when a reactor facility 
demands fuel, \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst}
deploys fuel fabrication facilities to create fuel
supply. 
For back-end facilities, the reactor generates spent fuel, and 
\texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst} deploys 
used fuel storage facilities to create capacity to store the spent fuel. 
Figure \ref{fig:insts} depicts a simple once-through fuel cycle 
and the \texttt{Institution} type governing each 
facility's deployment.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Deployment-Driving Method}}
\label{sec:ddm}
To prevent over-deployment of facilities with an intermittent 
supply such as reactors that require refueling, and
to prevent infinite deployment of a facility that demands 
a commodity no longer available in the simulation, 
we introduced the capability to deploy facilities 
based on the difference between predicted demand and installed capacity. 
The user may deploy facilities based on the difference 
between predicted demand and predicted supply, \textit{or}
predicted demand and installed capacity. 
For example, a reprocessing plant that fabricates Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor 
(SFR) fuel demands for Pu after depletion of the existing Pu inventory and 
decommissioning of the LWR reactors that produce it. 
If we used the deployment-driving method driven by 
the difference in predicted demand and predicted supply, this results in 
infinite deployment of reprocessing facilities in a futile attempt 
to produce SFR fuel, crashing the simulation. 
Instead, if we use the deployment-driving method driven by the
difference in predicted demand and installed capacity, only one reprocessing 
facility will be deployed, the simulation will finish, and the user will see that 
a large Pu inventory must be accumulated. 
Therefore, using the deployment-driving method that deploys facilities based on 
the difference between predicted demand and installed capacity is ideal for most 
transition scenarios. 

\subsubsection{\textbf{Input Variables}}
Table \ref{tab:inputs} lists and gives examples of the input 
variables \deploy accepts. 
The user must define the following input variables: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{available facilities for \deploy to deploy in the simulation and their respective capacities.}
The user must define the facilities he/she wants \deploy to deploy. It is the user's responsibility to 
ensure the defined facilities create a supply chain to produce the demand driving commodity.
\item \textbf{the demand driving commodity and its demand equation.} For most simulations, the demand driving 
commodity is power. The demand equation is defined by a mathematical equation with units of MW. For example, 
a constant power demand equation is $10000$, while a linearly increasing power demand equation is $100t$.
\item \textbf{the deployment driving method}. This input variable is described above.
\item \textbf{the prediction method}. This input variable is described below.
\end{itemize}

There are also optional input variables: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{supply/capacity buffers for individual commodities.} This input variable is described below.
\item \textbf{facility preferences.} This input variable is described below.
\item \textbf{facility fleet shares.} This input variable is described below.
\end{itemize}

                    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
    
    \subsubsection{\textbf{Supply/Capacity Buffer}}
    \label{sec:buf}
    The user has the option to specify a 
    supply buffer for each commodity; \deploy accounts for the buffer when 
    calculating predicted demand and deploys facilities accordingly.
    The buffer is defined as a percentage: 
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:perc}
        S_{pwb} &= S_{p}(1+d)
    \end{align}
    or absolute value: 
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:abs}
        S_{pwb} &= S_{p}+b 
        \intertext{where:}
        S_{pwb} &= \mbox{predicted supply/capacity with buffer} \nonumber\\
        S_p &= \mbox{predicted supply/capacity} \nonumber\\
        d &= \mbox{buffer's percentage value in decimal form} \nonumber\\
        b &= \mbox{buffer's absolute value} \nonumber
    \end{align}

    Using the buffer capability and  
    installed capacity to drive facility deployment in a transition 
    scenario simulation will effectively minimize undersupply of a 
    commodity while avoiding excessive oversupply. 
    This is demonstrated in Section \ref{sec:demo}. 
    
    \subsubsection{\textbf{Facility Preference and Fleet Share}}
    \label{sec:pref}
    The user can define time-dependent preference equations to facilities'  
    that supply the same commodity. 
    If there are two reactor types, \glspl{LWR} and \glspl{SFR}, in a simulation, 
    the user can make use of time-dependent 
    preferences to make the simulation deploy LWRs at earlier times 
    in the simulation, and deploy SFRs at later times in the 
    simulation when there is a power demand. 
    In Table \ref{tab:inputs}, 
    the user defined that the LWR has a preference of $100-t$, while 
    the SFR has a preference of $t-99$. 
    Figure \ref{fig:prefplot} depicts how the preference for each reactor changes 
    with time. 
    When there is a power undersupply, \deploy will deploy the reactor that has a
    larger preference at that time step.
    At time step 100, LWR preference is 0, while SFR preference is 1; 
    therefore a SFR is deployed if there is a power shortage. 
    Thus, the transition occurs at the $100^{th}$ time step.

    \begin{figure}[]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/prefplot}
        \end{center}	
            \caption{\deploy has a $100-t$ preference for LWRs and a $t-99$ preference for SFRs.
            When there is a power undersupply, \deploy will deploy the reactor that has a
            larger preference at that time step.}
        \label{fig:prefplot}
    \end{figure}

    The user also has the option to specify fleet-share for facilities 
    that provide the same commodity. 
    For example, if there are two reactor types, \gls{MOX} LWRs and SFRs, in a simulation,
    the user can make use of fleet-share specifications to determine the 
    percentage of power supplied by each reactor.   
    When MOX LWR has a share of $s\%$ and 
    \gls{SFR} has a share of $(100-s)\%$, 
    MOX LWR deployment constrains to $s\%$ of total power demand 
    and SFR deployment constrains to $(100-s)\%$ of total power demand. 

    The transition year is selected by customizing facility 
    preferences to prefer advanced reactors at that year.
    The fleet-share percentage determines the
    share of each type of reactor to transition to. 
    Figure \ref{fig:deployflow} shows the logical flow of
    which facility \deploy deploys when there are multiple facilities 
    offering the same commodity.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Prediction Methods}}
\label{sec:pm}
\deploy records supply and demand at each time step for all 
commodities. Time-series data informs \deploy's time series 
forecasting methods which predict future supply and demand for each 
commodity.  
The time series forecasting methods investigated include non-optimizing, 
deterministic-optimizing, and stochastic-optimizing methods. 
Non-optimizing methods are techniques that harness 
simple moving average and autoregression concepts which use 
historical data to infer future supply and demand values. 
Deterministic-optimizing and stochastic-optimizing 
methods are techniques 
that use an assortment of more sophisticated time series forecasting 
concepts to predict future supply and demand values. 
Deterministic-optimizing methods give deterministic solutions,
while stochastic-optimizing methods give stochastic solutions. 

Depending on the scenario in question, each forecasting method 
offers distinct benefits and disadvantages.
The various methods are compared for each type of simulation 
to determine the most effective prediction method for 
a given scenario. 
The following sections describe the prediction methods. 

\noindent
\textit{Non-Optimizing Methods}

Non-optimizing methods include: Moving Average (\texttt{MA}), 
Autoregressive Moving Average (\texttt{ARMA}), and 
Autoregressive Heteroskedasticity (\texttt{ARCH}). 
The \texttt{MA} method calculates the average of 
a user-defined number of previous entries in a commodity's 
time series and returns it as the predicted value: 

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:ma}
	Predicted\ Value &= \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N V_n}{n}.
	\intertext{where:}
	V_n &= \mbox{Time series value} \nonumber\\
	N &= \mbox{length of timeseries} \nonumber
\end{align}

The \texttt{ARMA} method combines moving average and
autoregressive models (equation \ref{eq:arma}), 
and is used to describe a time series in terms of moving 
average and autoregression polynomials \cite{petris_r_2010}.
The first term is a constant, second term is 
white noise, the third term is the autoregressive
model, and the fourth term is the moving average
model.
The \texttt{ARMA} method is more accurate than the 
\texttt{MA} method 
because of the inclusion of the autoregressive term: 
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:arma}
	X_t &= c + \epsilon_t + 
	\sum_{i=1}^p\varphi_i X_{t-i} +	
	\sum_{i=1}^q\theta_i\epsilon_{t-i}.
	\intertext{where:}
    c &= \mbox{a constant} \nonumber\\
    \epsilon_t &= \mbox{error terms (white noise)} \nonumber\\
    \varphi &= \mbox{the autoregressive model’s parameters} \nonumber\\
    \theta &= \mbox{the moving average model’s parameters} \nonumber \\
    p &= \mbox{order of the autoregressive polynomial} \nonumber \\
    q &= \mbox{order of the moving average polynomial} \nonumber
\end{align}

The \texttt{ARCH} method models time series data by describing the 
variance of the current 
error term as a function of the sizes of the previous time periods' 
error terms \cite{engle_autoregressive_1982}. 
This allows the method to support changes in the time dependent volatility, 
such as increasing and decreasing volatility in the same series
\cite{engle_autoregressive_1982}.
The \texttt{ARCH} method is
better than the \texttt{ARMA} method for volatile 
time-series data \cite{flanagan_methods_2019}. 
The StatsModels \cite{github_community_statsmodels:_2019}
Python package is used to implement \texttt{ARMA} and 
\texttt{ARCH} methods in \deploy. 

\noindent
\textit{Deterministic-Optimizing Methods}

Deterministic methods include
Fast Fourier Transform (\texttt{FFT}), 
Polynomial Fit (\texttt{POLY}), 
Exponential Smoothing (\texttt{EXP-SMOOTHING}), 
and Triple Exponential Smoothing (\texttt{HOLT-WINTERS}). 
The \texttt{FFT} method uses the fast fourier transform
algorithm to map a time series into the frequency domain. 
The algorithm returns complex numbers from which frequency, 
amplitude, and phase is extracted. 
Future demand and supply values are predicted by summing 
the significant components, then using the inverse 
fourier transform method to return it into a usable form. 
The discrete fourier transform (DFT) transforms a sequence of 
N complex numbers ($X_k$) into another sequence of complex numbers
($x_n$) \cite{rao_fast_2011}:

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:fft}
	X_k &= \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n e^{-i2\pi kn/N}.
    \intertext{where:}
    X &= \mbox{sequence of complex numbers} \nonumber \\
    k &= 0,...,N-1 \nonumber\\
    N &= \mbox{No. of complex numbers} \nonumber\\
    x &= \mbox{sequence of complex numbers} \nonumber \\
    n &= 0,...,N-1 \nonumber
\end{align}

This method is implemented in \deploy using the 
SciPy \cite{jones_scipy:_2016} Python package. 

The \texttt{POLY} method fits the time series data 
with a user-defined $n^{th}$ degree polynomial and uses 
the fitted trend-line to determine future demand and 
supply values: 

\begin{align}
    Y_t &= \beta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N \beta_n t^n + \varepsilon \\
    \intertext{where:}
    t &= \mbox{time index} \nonumber \\
    n &= \mbox{polynomial order} \nonumber \\
    \beta &= \mbox{fitted parameters} \nonumber 
\end{align}

This method was implemented in \deploy using the 
NumPy \cite{developers_numpy_2013} Python package. 
The \texttt{EXP-SMOOTHING} and \texttt{HOLT-WINTERS} 
methods use a weighted average 
of time-series data with exponentially decaying weights 
for older time series values \cite{hyndman_forecasting:_2018}
to create a model to determine future demand and supply values. 
The \texttt{EXP-SMOOTHING} method excels in 
modeling univariate time series data without trend or seasonality
\cite{hyndman_forecasting:_2018}: 

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:expsm}
    y_{t+1} &= \alpha y_i + (1-\alpha)y_t. \\ 
    \intertext{where:}
    y &= \mbox{timeseries value} \nonumber \\
    \alpha &= \mbox{smoothing factor } (0 < \alpha < 1)
\end{align}

The \texttt{HOLT-WINTERS} method applies triple exponential 
smoothing, resulting in higher accuracy when 
modeling seasonal time series data 
\cite{sematech_engineering_2006}: 

\begin{align}
    F_{t+m} &= (S_t +mb_t)I_{t-L+m} \\
    S_t &= \alpha \frac{y_t}{I_{t-L}}+(1-\alpha)(S_{t-1}+b_{t-1}) \nonumber \\
    b_t &= \gamma(S_t-S_{t-1})+)(1-\gamma)b_{t-1} \nonumber \\
    I_t &= \beta \frac{y_t}{S_t} + (1-\beta)I_{t-L} \nonumber \\
    \intertext{where:}
    F &= \mbox{forecast at m periods ahead} \nonumber \\
    t &= \mbox{time period index} \nonumber \\
    S &= \mbox{smoothed observation} \nonumber \\
    y &= \mbox{the observation} \nonumber \\
    b &= \mbox{trend factor} \nonumber \\
    I &= \mbox{seasonal index} \nonumber \\
    \alpha, \beta, \gamma &= \mbox{constants} \nonumber
\end{align}

The StatsModels \cite{github_community_statsmodels:_2019}
Python package was used to implement the \texttt{EXP-SMOOTHING} 
and \texttt{HOLT-WINTERS} methods in \deploy. 

\noindent
\textit{Stochastic-Optimizing Methods}

We implemented one stochastic-optimizing method: step-wise 
seasonal method (\texttt{SW-}

\noindent
\texttt{SEASONAL}). 
The method was implemented in \deploy by the auto \gls{ARIMA} 
method in the pmdarima \cite{noauthor_pmdarima:_2019}
Python package. 
The \gls{ARIMA} model is a dependent time series that is 
modeled as a linear combination of its own past values 
and past values of an error series \cite{institute_sas_1985}: 

\begin{align}
    (1-B)^dY_t &= \mu + \frac{\theta(B)}{\phi(B)}a_t \\ 
    \intertext{where:}
    t &= \mbox{time index} \nonumber \\
    \mu &= \mbox{mean term} \nonumber \\
    B &= \mbox{backshift operator, such that} BX_t = X_{t-1} \nonumber \\
    \phi(B) &= \mbox{autoregressive operator} \nonumber \\
    \theta(B) &= \mbox{moving average operator} \nonumber \\
    a_t &= \mbox{random error} \nonumber 
\end{align}

\section{Sensitivity Analysis Capabilities}
In this work, \Cyclus and DYMOND are coupled with Dakota 
\cite{eldred_dakota_2010} to give them
sensitivity analysis, 
uncertainty quantification, and optimization capabilities. 
Dakota is a well supported sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, 
and optimization tool that provides a flexible interface between 
analysis codes and iterative system analysis methods, created by \gls{SNL} 
\cite{turner_virtual_nodate}. 
Other pieces of nuclear engineering software are coupled with 
Dakota to conduct sensitivity analysis
\cite{turner_virtual_nodate,zhang_uncertainty_nodate}. 

The process of coupling with Dakota is similar 
for both nuclear fuel cycle simulators. 
Figure \ref{fig:dakota-NFC-flow} depicts the coupling; 
Dakota wraps each of the nuclear fuel cycle simulators.
In this work, we developed the Python interface between 
Dakota and the nuclear fuel cycle simulators.
The Python interface has three functions: 
(1) edit the nuclear fuel cycle simulator's input file based on Dakota's input values, 
(2) run the simulation with the newly edited nuclear fuel cycle simulator's input file, and 
(3) read the nuclear fuel cycle simulator output file and returns values of interest 
to the Dakota output file. 
The Dakota input file defines the parameters for the sensitivity analysis, 
uncertainty quantification, or optimization study.
The difference between the Python interface between \Cyclus-Dakota and DYMOND-Dakota 
is the methods used to read and write to their input and output files.

\section{DYMOND}
DYMOND \cite{yacout_modeling_2005} is a nuclear fuel cycle simulator developed 
at Argonne National Laboratory (\gls{ANL}). 
It is built using the AnyLogic simulation software with 
Microsoft Excel templates for data input and output. 
The primary inputs to this code are time-dependent power demand, 
reactor, and fuel cycle characteristics 
\cite{feng_standardized_2016}.   
The code calls ORIGEN \cite{bell_origen_1973} during the simulation 
to conduct reactor depletion calculations. 
DYMOND records isotopic mass flows and inventories
at a system-level.
DYMOND's primary design objective is ease of understanding the  
simulator's behavior and variables. 

In DYMOND, reactor facilities are automatically deployed to 
meet user-defined power demand, and the user can define 
the percentage share of energy for up to five reactor types. 
The user also defines the fuel loading model used to calculate 
reactor spent fuel compositions, the type of reprocessing 
technology for each reactor type, and the length 
of used fuel cooling time. 
In DYMOND, the user must define the deployment schedule for 
the reprocessing plants; the cooling pools and storage pools 
are all assumed to have infinite capacities. 
DYMOND does not have demand-driven deployment capabilities for 
supporting fuel cycle facilities. 

The difference between \Cyclus and DYMOND is that \Cyclus uses 
agent-based modeling for all facilities and mass flows, 
whereas DYMOND uses fleet-based modeling for all facilities and 
mass flows except for reactor facilities. 
Compared to \Cyclus, DYMOND is easier to use but less flexible. 

\subsection{DYMOND-Dakota Coupling (\texttt{ddwrapper})}
% python scripts to parse the excel input and output templates 
In the interface between DYMOND and Dakota, the Pywin32 
\cite{hammond_python_2000}
Python package is used to parse the Excel input file and to 
write to the relevant Excel cells accordingly. 
Pywin32 is a thin Python wrapper that enables interaction 
with COM objects \cite{hammond_python_2000}. 
The Pandas \cite{mckinney_pandas:_2011} Python
package is used to analyze the excel output database 
by taking the values of interest and formatting them 
to return to the Dakota output file.
Scripts in the \texttt{ddwrapper} Github repository \cite{chee_gwenchee/ddwrapper_2019}
demonstrate DYMOND and Dakota coupling. 

\subsection{\Cyclus-Dakota Coupling (\texttt{dcwrapper})}
In the interface between \Cyclus and Dakota, 
the Jinja2 \cite{ronacher_welcome_2018} Python package is used 
to edit the relevant parts of a \Cyclus XML input file. 
Jinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating 
language for Python. 
We use \textsc{Cymetric} to analyze \Cyclus' output database. 
\textsc{Cymetric} \cite{scopatz_cymetric_2015} is a general analysis library and 
tool created in 2015 to ease interaction with \Cyclus' SQL database. 
Scripts in the \texttt{dcwrapper} Github repository \cite{chee_arfc/dcwrapper_2019}
demonstrate \Cyclus and Dakota coupling.
