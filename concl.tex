% difference between cyclus and dymond 
% cyclus is more flexible but harder to use 
% dymond is rigid in the type of scenarios to run 
% more comparisons of cyclus and dymond in this section 
%or after demonstration. 

\Cyclus is shown to be flexible in setting up successful transition 
scenarios when input parameters are slightly varied.
DYMOND is able to successfully set up a transition scenario, if the 
user ensures to set up a fuel management strategy correctly. 
It is important that \glspl{NFCSim} are flexible and resilient to 
perturbations in transition scenario input parameters.
