%or after demonstration. 

% Research objectives 
The objectives of this thesis were to: 
(1) develop a capability in \Cyclus to ease the setup of 
transition scenarios, 
(2) develop capabilities in \Cyclus and DYMOND to conduct 
sensitivity analysis,
(3) demonstrate setting up of \Cyclus transition scenarios using the 
capability developed,
(4) use \Cyclus and DYMOND to conduct sensitivity analysis studies
, and
(5) compare \Cyclus and DYMOND's capabilities in conducting \gls{SA}. 

All these objectives were met. 
In this thesis, a new capability in \Cyclus was introduced 

\Cyclus is shown to be flexible in setting up successful transition 
scenarios when input parameters are slightly varied.
DYMOND is able to successfully set up a transition scenario, if the 
user ensures to set up a fuel management strategy correctly. 
It is important that \gls{NFC} simulators are flexible and resilient to 
perturbations in transition scenario input parameters.
