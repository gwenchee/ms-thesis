% difference between cyclus and dymond 
% cyclus is more flexible but harder to use 
% dymond is rigid in the type of scenarios to run 
% more comparisons of cyclus and dymond in this section 
%or after demonstration. 

In this thesis, a new capability in \Cyclus was introduced 

\Cyclus is shown to be flexible in setting up successful transition 
scenarios when input parameters are slightly varied.
DYMOND is able to successfully set up a transition scenario, if the 
user ensures to set up a fuel management strategy correctly. 
It is important that \gls{NFC} simulators are flexible and resilient to 
perturbations in transition scenario input parameters.
