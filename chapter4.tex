\chapter{Successful Transition Scenarios}

\section{Demonstration}
This section will demonstrate and evaluate 
setting up of successful transition scenarios 
with \Cyclus and DYMOND. 
The overall measure of a successful transition scenario  
is that there is no undersupply of power. 
The sub-measures are: 
(1) to minimize the number of time 
steps of undersupply or under capacity of any 
commodity, 
(2) to minimize excessive oversupply of all commodities.

% difference between cyclus and dymond 
% cyclus is more flexible but harder to use 
% dymond is rigid in the type of scenarios to run 
% more comparisons of cyclus and dymond in this section 
%or after demonstration.
