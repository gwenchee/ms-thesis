\section{Motivation}
%[Climate Change, carbon free energy, need nuclear]

The impact of climate change on natural and human systems 
is becoming increasingly apparent.
Increases in global average 
surface temperatures, sea levels, and larger climate extremes
are a few of the consequences of elevated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
concentrations.
The production and use of energy contributes to 
two-thirds of the total GHG emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}. 
Furthermore, global energy demand is forecasted to increase as human 
population increases and previously under-developed nations 
urbanize rapidly. 
The impact of the growing energy demand on climate change 
will heavily depend on the 
types of power generation technologies used. 
Large scale deployment of nuclear power plants has significant 
potential to reduce GHG production due to their low 
carbon emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.  

However, the nuclear power industry is facing four major challenges 
towards large scale deployment of nuclear power: 
cost, safety, proliferation, and waste 
\cite{massachusetts_institute_of_technology_future_2003}. 
Nuclear power has high overall lifetime costs and increases 
risks of nuclear proliferation. 
There is also an unresolved long-term nuclear waste management 
strategy and perceived adverse safety, environmental, and health 
effects \cite{massachusetts_institute_of_technology_future_2003}. 
The nuclear power industry must overcome these four challenges 
to ensure continued global use and expansion 
of nuclear energy technology. 

% Evaluation Screening Study 
The present \gls{NFC} in the \gls{US} is a once-through cycle 
in which fabricated nuclear fuel is used once and placed into 
storage to await disposal. 
This once-through fuel cycle is associated with the 
challenges described above.
To overcome these challenges the 
\gls{DOE} chartered an evaluation and screening study 
of a comprehensive set of nuclear \gls{FCO} 
to identify \glspl{FCO} with potential 
to provide substantial improvements in the four challenge areas
compared to the current 
\gls{NFC} in the \gls{US} \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}. 

The study concluded that fuel cycles with continuous recycling
of co-extracted U/Pu or U/TRU in fast spectrum critical reactors
consistently scored high overall performance in the following 
categories: nuclear waste management, environmental impact, 
and resource utilization. 
To understand the end-state benefits of each evaluation group (EG), 
the study assumed equilibrium nuclear energy systems. 
Therefore, evaluation of the transition from the current 
once-through fuel cycle to these promising 
future end-states \cite{feng_standardized_2016} 
is the logical next step. 
This propelled nuclear fuel cycle transition 
scenario analysis research. 

\subsection{Transition Scenarios}
To successfully analyze time-dependent transition
scenarios, it is necessary to develop \gls{NFC} simulator tools to  
automate the setup of transition scenarios. 
Many existing \gls{NFC} simulator tools have conducted 
these analyses \cite{feng_standardized_2016,bae_standardized_2019,coquelet-pascal_cosi6:_2015}
and faced challenges stemming from the large input parameter
sample space.
Since many of these input parameters are interdependent, it is 
a tedious process to use trial and error to manually find a balance 
between various input parameters to set up a successful transition 
scenario. 
 
In reality, the real transition process will 
inevitably diverge from the modeled transition scenario. 
It is insufficient to set up only one transition scenario to model 
the future projections of nuclear power.
Therefore, it is imperative to conduct \gls{SA} to understand 
the effects of variation in input parameters on 
relevant output parameters. 

\section{Objectives}
Knowing the difficulties faced by \glspl{NFCSim} to model 
transition scenarios and conduct sensitivity analysis, 
the objectives of this thesis are to: 
(1) develop a capability in \Cyclus to ease the setup of 
transition scenarios, 
(2) evaluate and compare \Cyclus and 
DYMOND on their capabilities to set up 
successful transition scenarios,
(3) develop capabilities in \Cyclus and DYMOND to conduct 
sensitivity analysis,
(4) use \Cyclus and DYMOND to conduct sensitivity analysis studies
, and
(5) compare \Cyclus and DYMOND's capabilities in conducting \gls{SA}.
